I am an enthusiast and a learner of contract bridge, which I think is the irreplaceable competitive game to sharpen memories and thinking skills and also a great release from a hectic work life.

When it comes to bidding, an art form in bridge with a rich history of insights from the game's masters, the system I prefer and constantly work hard to get better at is <strong>Precision</strong>, of which the fundamentation is the book, *The Precision System of Contract Bridge Bidding*, by Charles H. Goren🔗<a href='https://1lib.sk/book/28962925/3c0972/the-precision-system-of-contract-bridge-bidding.html'>[Z-Library]</a>. I am fond of how he put it then: "Precision is enjoyable, logical, and not hard to learn." And of course, it is no wonder that the system introduced originally in the 1970s has earned its place and is still played at bridge tables all over the world.

I'd always heard that bridge was one of those games you just can't put down. It wasn't until I started playing it in university that I probably understood why: the beauty lies in the card play. It really takes practice to go from "playing ably" to "playing correctly", but getting to "playing cleverly" is undoubtedly a true test of mastery. For that, the book, *Adventures in Card Play*, by Géza Ottlik and Hugh Kelsey🔗<a href='https://1lib.sk/book/884719/fa62bd/adventures-in-card-play-master-bridge-series.html'>[Z-Library]</a> is an absolute beacon, a cornerstone for anyone looking to improve. As for the rest? That’s what a long time of practice and endless fun is for.
